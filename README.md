## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Master’s student in **Applied Computer Science** at **Wrocław University of Science and Technology**, currently researching:

- Synthetic Data Generation  
- Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning  
- AI for Healthcare  

My thesis focuses on **privacy-preserving synthetic data generation** for pattern classification—building models that protect user confidentiality while maintaining high accuracy and explainability.

I previously worked as a **Data Analyst** at Advanced Pipeline Services LLC in Abu Dhabi, where I built analytics tools, automated workflows, designed dashboards, and managed secure database systems.
